                <h2>Rich and deeply intertwined</h2>
                <small>District's name, Kota Tinggi, which means "High Fort"</small>
                <p>The history of Kota Tinggi is rich and deeply 
                intertwined with the cultural and political evolution of Johor 
                and the broader Malay world. The district's name, Kota Tinggi, which means "High Fort" in Malay, was given by Sultan Mahmud 
                because of the high ground on which it was built, compared to the river level.</p>

                <small>Continuation of the Malacca Sultanate after the Portuguese captured Malacca in 1511</small>
                <p>Kota Tinggi's significance dates back to the period of the Johor Malay Sultanate, 
                    which was a continuation of the Malacca Sultanate after the Portuguese captured 
                    Malacca in 1511. Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah II established the Johor Sultanate in 1528, 
                    making it one of the most powerful empires in the Malay Peninsula. Kota Tinggi, 
                    strategically located at the estuary of Sungai Johor, became an important center for administration and trade.</p>
